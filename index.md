## Carteret Solar Adoption and Prospect for Community Solar

Community solar is a ambitious attempt to tackle the issue of inequality in access to cheap renewable energy. While wealthier homeowners may be able to afford the significant upfront cost of installing rooftop solar, low-to-moderate income households are often left behind in the transition to green energy. Community solar allows installations on commercial, public, non-profit buildings to serve low-to-moderate income housheold in their communities with the savings associated with utilizing solar energy. 

This project hopes to map out current installations in Carteret, NJ which can have a part of their capacity designated to serve the community, as well as non-residential land parcels that have significant enough roof space and appropriate interconnectivity ability to allow for new projects.
